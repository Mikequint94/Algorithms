Functional Programming:

style of programming in which pure functions are the main unit of computation

Nicer than imperative like jQuery vs. React (nicer).
possible in all languages, better in some

No side effects to be pure:
no ajax requests, printing, changing external state.

Same input => always same output is pure function.

purity requires immutability.

functional core, imperative shell.
like react/redux.  My code never mutates DOM or mutates state,
  the impure parts are not the important part.

impure functions could be doing anything (hidden inputs/outputs), but pure function you know exactly what it does or doesnt do.

Therefore, a pure function can never break other code
